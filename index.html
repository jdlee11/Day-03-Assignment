        <p>One evening, Māui and his brothers were making a hāngi
          for their evening meal. They had just finished heating the
          stones when the sun went down and it quickly became too
          dark to see. Māui was annoyed with having to eat his food in
          the dark. He stood in the light of the fire and addressed his
          people.<br><br>

          "Every day we have to rush to do our chores and gather our
          food before the sun sets. Why should we be slaves to the sun?
          I will catch the sun before it rises, and teach it to travel
          slowly across the sky!" But one of the brothers was quick to
          criticise, not believing Māui could possibly do such a thing.
          "It would be impossible to catch the sun, he's much bigger than
          any bird you've ever caught!" "The heat and flames would surely
          burn you to death," said another. "I think he's got <span class="underlined">sunstroke</span>,"
          another added, and they all laughed.</p>

          <h3>SURFING TIPS</h3>
          <p>Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day cough furball
            or poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Leave dead animals
            as gifts has closed eyes but still sees you for chirp at birds
            or sun bathe. Kitty power! lick plastic bags meow all night having
            their mate disturbing sleeping humans but fall over dead (not really
            but gets sypathy) but chase after silly colored fish toys around the
            house, hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser.
            Sleep in the bathroom sink kick up litter, or curl into a furry donut.</p>

            When they had quietened down, Māui took the sacred jawbone of
            his ancestor from his belt and waved it in the air. "I have
            achieved many things that were thought impossible – gaining
            fire from Mahuika, catching the greatest fish in the world,
            descending to the underworld, and many more. With this magic
            jawbone, gifted by <span class="underlined">Murirangawhenua</span>, and with your help, I will
            succeed in conquering the sun!". The majority of the people agreed
            that Māui had achieved many great feats, they decided to help Māui
            in his quest.<br><br>

            The next day Māui and his whānau collected a huge amount of flax,
            Māui then taught them how to make flax ropes, a skill he learnt
            when he was in the underworld. They made square shaped ropes,
            tuamaka, flat ropes, paharahara, and twisted the flax to make
            round ropes. After five days the ropes were completed and Māui said
            a special karakia over them. "Taura nui, taura roa, taura kaha,
            taura toa, taura here i a Tamanuiterā, whakamaua kia mau kia ita!".<br><br>

            During the night, Māui and his brothers hoisted the ropes and travelled
            towards the east to where the sun first rises. They hid under trees
            and bushes during the day, so the sun wouldn't see them approaching.
            They collected water in calabashes as they travelled, which Māui said
            was necessary for their task ahead.</p>
